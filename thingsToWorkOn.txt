things to work on

1. Unable to set Ftest y axis label. Karim April 15, 2013
   I tried to fix this with:

function(x, 
         ftbase=1.01, 
         siglines=NULL, 
         xlab="Frequency",
         ylab="Harmonic F-test Statistic",
         ...)

and 

##if(is.null(ylab)) ylab <- "Harmonic F-test Statistic"

but this did not work nicely, I placed a function plotFtest in multitaperDevelopment which the 
Fix works nicely if the function is called directly. The problem occurs when the .plotFtest is called by the parent plot.mtm

## incomplete Fix in multiatperDevelopment (not on CRAN)


2. Real bug in the plot function for jack knife coherence. This bug shows up in the example
mtm.coh. The problem is the coherence is higher than expected. Using R's function pretty more or 
less gets around this except in highly coherent data. A fix in currently in the multitaper 
Development package. I have attempted to fix this and the change (FIX) is in 1.0-5.

3. Stepsize in complex demodulation is set to one. This can be changed, and I believe that the 1's can be changed in:
jSeq nResultVals, and iSeq

Not addressed.

4. Added Jan 30, 2014,

deltat() does not return an error or the correct value. Is this the same with other spectral objects. also we have $mtm$deltaT, should we change it to deltat.

I do not think this an important  issue as spec.pgram does not has similar issues. 
data(percivalAR4)
resdt2 <- spec.pgram(ts(percivalAR4, deltat=2), pad=1024)
deltat(resdt2)
##[1] 1



Add Wes' Notes Oct. 2010

1. Rewrite the sine tapers - they're broken. Kian sent me information, but basically, scrap them and rewrite from scratch.

2. Add in the line component extraction code from AHItools.

3. Add in the transfer function estimation from Dave's package.

4. Rewrite all of the plotting stuff to use ggplot2

5. Double check all of the algorithms for possible bugs, especially the adaptive weighting, try to clean up some of the comments to make it easier to learn from for new incoming students.

6. Check the spectrum package psd for inspiration of useful functions.

7. Integrate Kian's masters F test statistics.

8. Call the whole thing multitaper v2.0.0

Karim's comments regarding Wes' notes.

We have to be careful to precisely define what a bug is. Ex: is it documentation or is it real. Example: Frank found a real bug which I corrected in 2017, and this time the update was to a documentation issue brought to my attention by Katherine Anarde from Rice and confirmed both by me and Dave R. 

There are some specific plot issues noted above which I have not fixed. I do not want to break anything so I would prefer the option to use ggplot2.

I don’t think double checking algos for bugs is realistic and may introduce more bugs. It’s best to track and fix bugs. However testing and comparing is appropriate. In the case of MTM the results are consistent with DJT, and very similar to other code. We need to be precise about the difference. I recall speaking to Glen’s student (Economist “L something?”) and he had some minor discrepancy; however, when I followed up I could not make sense of it and despite our attempts, it was my opinion that neither he mpr O could not precisely define the error.

The following have been addressed:

1. Real bug reported July 2 2013
This bug affects the way deltat is taken from the ts object. Example:
deltat is not captured in the time series object.

data(willamette)
willamette <- ts(data=willamette, start=(1950+9/12), freq=12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024) ## plots frequencies 0 to 1/2
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, dT=1/12) ## plots frequencies correctly

## attempted fix same day example where fix works

data(willamette)
willamette <- ts(data=willamette, start=(1950+9/12), freq=12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, dT=1/12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, dT=1)

Fix in version 1.0-7 (karim)
data(willamette)
willamette <- ts(data=willamette, start=(1950+9/12), freq=12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024) ## plots frequencies 0 to 1/2
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, deltat=1/12) ## plots frequencies correctly

## attempted fix same day example where fix works

data(willamette)
willamette <- ts(data=willamette, start=(1950+9/12), freq=12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, deltat=1/12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, deltat=1)

This also works in 1.0-8 using both deltat, and depreciated dT.

## notes Feb 25
removed multitaper-package.Rd due to conflicting version info in documentation. This file does not exist in several popular packages and R has a packageDescripton function.
