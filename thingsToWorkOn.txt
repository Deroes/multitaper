things to work on

1. Unable to set Ftest y axis label. Karim April 15, 2013
   I tried to fix this with:

function(x, 
         ftbase=1.01, 
         siglines=NULL, 
         xlab="Frequency",
         ylab="Harmonic F-test Statistic",
         ...)

and 

##if(is.null(ylab)) ylab <- "Harmonic F-test Statistic"

but this did not work nicely, I placed a function plotFtest in multitaperDevelopment which the 
Fix works nicely if the function is called directly. The problem occurs when the .plotFtest is called by the parent plot.mtm

## incomplete Fix in multiatperDevelopment (not on CRAN)


2. Real bug in the plot function for jack knife coherence. This bug shows up in the example
mtm.coh. The problem is the coherence is higher than expected. Using R's function pretty more or 
less gets around this except in highly coherent data. A fix in currently in the multitaper 
Development package. I have attempted to fix this and the change (FIX) is in 1.0-5.

3. Stepsize in complex demodulation is set to one. This can be changed, and I believe that the 1's can be changed in:
jSeq
nResultVals, and 
iSeq

Not addressed.

4. Added Jan 30, 2014,

deltat() does not return an error or the correct value. Is this the same with other spectral objects.
also we have $mtm$deltaT, should we change it to deltat.

I do not think this an important  issue as spec.pgram does not has similar issues. 
data(percivalAR4)
resdt2 <- spec.pgram(ts(percivalAR4, deltat=2), pad=1024)
deltat(resdt2)
##[1] 1


The following have been addressed:

1. Real bug reported July 2 2013
This bug affects the way deltat is taken from the ts object. Example:
deltat is not captured in the time series object.

data(willamette)
willamette <- ts(data=willamette, start=(1950+9/12), freq=12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024) ## plots frequencies 0 to 1/2
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, dT=1/12) ## plots frequencies correctly

## attempted fix same day example where fix works

data(willamette)
willamette <- ts(data=willamette, start=(1950+9/12), freq=12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, dT=1/12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, dT=1)

Fix in version 1.0-7 (karim)
data(willamette)
willamette <- ts(data=willamette, start=(1950+9/12), freq=12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024) ## plots frequencies 0 to 1/2
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, deltat=1/12) ## plots frequencies correctly

## attempted fix same day example where fix works

data(willamette)
willamette <- ts(data=willamette, start=(1950+9/12), freq=12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, deltat=1/12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, deltat=1)

This also works in 1.0-8 using both deltat, and depreciated dT.

## notes Feb 25
removed multitaper-package.Rd due to conflicting version info in documentation. This file does not exist in several popular packages and R has a packageDescripton function.
