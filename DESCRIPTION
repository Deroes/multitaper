Description:  Provides general functions and utilities for multitaper spectral analysis using the Discrete Prolate Spheroidal (Slepian) sequences and the Sine tapers. When used with the Slepian sequences, the packages implements the adaptive weighted multitaper spectral estimate, with nonparametric jackknife variance estimate, Thomson's Harmonic F-test, a multitaper version of the bivariate (magnitude squared and phase) coherence, with jackknife variance. The package uses the filtering properties of the Slepian sequences to perform complex demodulation, and it provides an interface similar to the complex demodulation function provided with S-plus. The function calls have been designed to be similar to R function calls for spectral estimation, and the package includes several spectral analysis tools. The package is (and has been) used and tested by members of Thomson's research group at Queen's University.
