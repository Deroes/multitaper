things to work on

1. Unable to set Ftest y axis label. Karim April 15, 2013
   I tried to fix this with:

function(x, 
         ftbase=1.01, 
         siglines=NULL, 
         xlab="Frequency",
         ylab="Harmonic F-test Statistic",
         ...)

and 

##if(is.null(ylab)) ylab <- "Harmonic F-test Statistic"

but this did not work nicely, I placed a function plotFtest in multitaperDevelopment which the 
Fix works nicely if the function is called directly. The problem occurs when the .plotFtest is called by the parent plot.mtm

2. Real bug in the plot function for jack knife coherence. This bug shows up in the example
mtm.coh. The problem is the coherence is higher than expected. Using R's function pretty more or less gets around this except in highly coherent data. A fix in currently in the multitaper Development package. I have attempted to fix this and the change in in 1.0-5.

3. Stepsize in complex demodulation is set to one. This can be changed, and I believe that the 1's can be changed in:
jSeq
nResultVals, and 
iSeq

4. Real bug reported July 2 2013
This bug affects the way deltat is taken from the ts object. Example:
deltat is not captured in the time series object.

data(willamette)
willamette <- ts(data=willamette, start=(1950+9/12), freq=12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024) ## plots frequencies 0 to 1/2
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, dT=1/12) ## plots frequencies correctly

## attempted fix same day example where fix works

data(willamette)
willamette <- ts(data=willamette, start=(1950+9/12), freq=12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, dT=1/12)
spec.mtm(willamette, nw=3, k=5, nFFT=1024, dT=1)

Fix in version 1.0-7 (karim)
