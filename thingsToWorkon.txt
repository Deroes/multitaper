things to work on

1. Unable to set Ftest y axis label. Karim April 15, 2013
   I tried to fix this with:

function(x, 
         ftbase=1.01, 
         siglines=NULL, 
         xlab="Frequency",
         ylab="Harmonic F-test Statistic",
         ...)

and 

##if(is.null(ylab)) ylab <- "Harmonic F-test Statistic"

but this did not work nicely, I placed a function plotFtest in multitaperDevelopment which the 
Fix works nicely if the function is called directly. The problem occurs when the .plotFtest is called by the parent plot.mtm
