This file tracks changes since the last package uploaded to CRAN.

Version 1.03 was the last upload and it only contained changes to comments.

Since 1.03, two changes were made as a result of an email from Brian Ripley.

1. Lazyloading has been removed from the descripiton file.
2.  FirstLib has been commented out. This file/should be deleted.
3. spec.mtm.Rd, changed dT to 1/12 (monthly) for willamette example in example, and the option log is added to the file.
4. Added ar 4 data as simulated by Don Percival as requested by reviewer.

The version label was also changed to 1.04 in the DESCRIPTION file. This will allow for testing --as.cran and on winbuilder.


Fri April 5, modified spec.mtm.Rd to indicate what cmv is when used in return internals. Note I would prefer to add this to values as suggested in the paper review.
