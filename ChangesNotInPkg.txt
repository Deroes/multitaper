This file tracks changes since the last package uploaded to CRAN.

Version 1.03 was the last upload and it only contained changes to comments.

Since 1.03, two changes were made as a result of an email from Brian Ripley.

1. Lazy loading has been removed from the description file.
2.  FirstLib has been commented out. This file/should be deleted. (deleted)
3. spec.mtm.Rd, changed dT to 1/12 (monthly) for willamette example in example, and the option log is added to the file.
4. Added ar 4 data as simulated by Don Percival as requested by reviewer.
5. Modified dpss to return theta, the default eigenvalues. Note DJT refers to this as Slepian eqn number 13 and I have done the same in dpss.Rd. I did not check Slepians paper as it is not online. (TODO: confirm eqn number). I did add the P and W reference and update the section to 8.3.
6. Changes to dpss stop if not condition.

The version label was also changed to 1.04 in the DESCRIPTION file. This will allow for testing --as.cran and on winbuilder.


Fri April 5, modified spec.mtm.Rd to indicate what cmv is when used in return internals. Note I would prefer to add this to values as suggested in the paper review.

April 28. Version 1.0-4 was uploaded to cran as it as of this point.


Since 1.04 (implemented in 1.05)

1. Changes to .Rbuildignore and gitignore. Check that these actually work on winbuilder. 
2. Set ByteCompile to true in the description file. I hope this will make things faster but it is a little risky.
3. Modification to plot.mtm.coh to use the R function pretty, also a change to the example of mtm.coh to make it appear nice. 

Since 1.05

1. Add vignette for use of fftw

Uploaded as version 1.06

Since 1.06

1. changed plots file to no longer call plot.spec but forcing class and calling generic. As per email from Ripley to allow for R 3.1.0
2. moved Rnw files to /vignettes as per check --as-cran note.
3. removed file Makevars.in in src as per check --as-cran.            

Version 1.07 will shortly be sent to winbuilder for testing and then to cran

Since 1.07

1. Comments added to F-test function .HF4mp1 (Sept 17, 2013
2. Vignette removed for now (sept 27, 2013)
3. R Code, and sine.f comments cleaned up (sept 27), commented out code removed.
4. Some changes to depreciate dT and replace with deltat to conform with R standard, this includes an hack for stripping variables from the plot function list suggested to Gavin Simpson by Brian Ripley. Basically I wrap the function with private/local functions lplot(x, ..., dt), which
calls plot(x, ...) thus stripping the dT depreciated variable. 
5. There was a match.call(expand.dots=TRUE) issue with dT once it became an optional parameter.
match.call(expand.dots=TRUE)$dT would return /112 instead if 1/12 when I put 1/12 in as an
example. It took me a bit to sort this. I ultimately used arglist <- list(...), and arglist$dT
which I could test if it was NULL and which then worked as expected. 

Uploaded 1.0-8 Sept 30.

Since 1.08

1. Added Bloomfield reference to demod.dpss.
2. Changed stop if not to give warnings in spec.mtm line no 130 to 139 of multitaper.R
